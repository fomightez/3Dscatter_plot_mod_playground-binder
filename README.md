# 3Dscatter_plot_mod_playground-binder
Playground to test 3D scatter plot examples in modern JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook via Binder

[3Dscatter_plot-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/3Dscatter_plot-binder) currently uses Jupyter Notbeook Classic (NbClassic).  
I want to see how the notebooks in the series handle modern JupyterLab 4 and Jupyter Notebook 7+ without making two repos with very similar content at this time.     
Currently, other than the text stating things, [3Dscatter_plot-binder](https://github.com/fomightez/3Dscatter_plot-binder) isn't *per se* composed to only run on NbClassic and so it makes more sense for now to use the same content and just have it so I can present the content using the newer software.  
(Not that was unlike the case with what became animated_matplotlib_classic-binder vs. what is now animated_matplotlib-binder with the former being set to work in NbClassic and the latter being for the modern software, and for most part needing very different code and so had to be separate.
